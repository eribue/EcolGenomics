### Entry 1: 2020-01-13, Monday.   

Today we discussed the definition of Ecological genomics and how it relates to the history of population genetics. Specifically, I learned about the founders of population genetics (Seawall Wright, R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane) and their contributions to the field. For example, Wright's island model is used to predict how subpopulations "represented by islands" may behave assuming population size is the same and always stable (don't grow or decline).

![Image result for wright's island model](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/~ucbhdjm/courses/b242/MigEvol/OneIsland.gif)

Notes: Key points from lecture

Fixation coefficient (Fst)- a measure differentiation among populations. 

* Fst values range from 0-1
  * High Fst value close to 1 infer that the population is highly differentiated (high variability) 
  * Values closer to 0 infer low differentiation
  * High values are associated with less migration (gene flow) and non-random mating

Selection sweeps- occurs when an allele becomes more frequent in the population- we can infer that this allele confers a beneficial trait.

Molecular evolution- "history encoded in DNA" can be examined at different levels

1. Populations
2. Organisms
3. Species

Kimura's Neutral Theory of Molecular Evolution- estimates the probability of a new mutation in a population (N)
$$
1/2N= μ
$$
Synonymous vs non-synonymous mutations-

* Synonymous mutations- does not alter the amino acid in the protein

* Non-synonymous mutations- alters the amino acid in the protein
  $$
  dN/dS
  $$
  N mutations/non syn. sites/ N of syn./ N of syn sites

  w= dN/dS 

  w>>1 or w>2 signal for positive selection

  w = 1 neutral

  w<< 1 negative "purifying selection"

Tajima's D-  𝜋 /s

ratio of nucleotide diversity ( 𝜋 )

no. of segregating sites (s)

High  𝜋  with rare variants in population

### Entry 2: 2020-01-15, Wednesday.   

Lecture notes: How do the questions tie in with the technology?

Things to consider: type organism/sample (tissue, environment, DNA, RNA)

Does the organism have a reference genome? How large is the genome? 

**Library preps**

1. **Whole-genome sequencing**

2. **RNAseq**

3. **Exome Capture**-  not a measurement of expression; focused on examining variation

   Exon- protein coding regions in DNA

   Exome - portion of the genome that codes for exons

   Biomedical uses- disease causing variants/rare diseases

   Ecological and evolutionary- genetic mapping of phenotypic traits, IDing causing variants, detecting selection in a genome

   Cost effective and allows one to beyond model taxa

   Information on life history strategies and molecular markers for evolution

   **Library prep:**

   1. Sample collection
   2. Fragmentation- "fragmented soup" blunt ends created, fragments same length, adenine tails added
   3. Enrichment of libraries- pull DNA and add probes 
      1. PCR- good for 100s loci, low cost, per probe cost is high
      2. De novo- good 100-1000 loci, high cost, per probe cost intermediate
      3. Divergent annotated genome- good for 100-1000s loci, cost per probe low,
   4. Purification
   5. Quality control

4. **RAD/GBS:** 

   RADseq: restriction site associated DNA seq.

   ​	Uses APK1- enzyme (restriction enzyme "cuts" palindromic sites) allows for barcode attachment

   Library prep:

   1. Genomic DNA
   2. Digest with 1 restriction enzyme
   3. Ligate adapters to fragments
   4. Multiplex (pool) samples
   5. PCR- allele drop-off issues-> PCR amplification does not work or cut site because of an existing variant thus reducing the amount of DNA being seq.

5. **Amplicon seq**- sequencing singular fragment of DNA- often highly conserved

   1. 16s RNA for bacteria
   2. ITS for fungi
   3. CO1 for animals

   **Library prep**

   1. DNA isolation
   2. PCR - amplify product of interest
   3. Add adapters- for barcoding
   4. Sequence

6. **Bisulfite seq: Identifies  methylated C's in genome.** 

   CG islands: GCGCGCGC - usually in non-coding DNA or promoter regions of a gene

   Library prep:

   1. Isolate DNA
   2. Treatment with bisulfite- converts methylated cytosine with a uracil
   3. PCR- amplify 
   4. Sequence treated samples
   5. Compare to untreated samples

CHIPseq: chromatin immunoprecipitation

Library prep:

1. Add fixative to fix all proteins attached to DNA
2. Immunoprecipitation: introduce an antibody that is specific to protein of interest
3. Sequence- data tells you where histone modifications are located

ATAC seq: Chromatin accesibility

"Tagementation": tagging probes + fragmenting DNA

1. Introduce a manufactured TE to fragment DNA
2. Load fragments into sequencer 
3. (HiSeq)
4. Global 3-D shape of the genome- crosslinks all touching DNA, only fragment those crosslinked DNA

**Sequencing platforms**

Illumina- for short read sequencing

sequencing: decoding nucleotide molecules

NGS- faster and cheaper

* Four step process:
  	1. Library prep: DNA fragmentation, attaching adapters
   	2. Cluster generation: lawn- contains complementary adapters + DNA polymerase + bases (ATCG) = creates clusters
   	3. Sequencing by synthesis: oligo's + fluorescent dNTPs = fluorescent signal is measured by the machine
   	4. Data analysis: filtering and mapping to reference genome

PacBio/Nanopore- long read sequencing

Long read seq: 

```mermaid

A(<b> Long read seq)
B(<b>SMART)
C(<b>Synthetic)
A --> B
A --> C
B --> D(PacBio Oxford Nanopore Technology)
C --> E(Illumina)

```

PacBio- small well set up where single DNA fragment foes in and polymerized

* dNTPs + fluorophores -> lasers and camera

### Entry 3: 2020-01-22, Wednesday.   

**Population genomics**

​	Why is it used? allows one to infer selection and drift across the genome

-Population genetics does not incorporate the genomic landscape and structure

-The effects of environmental changes can be tracked via changes in abundance and distribution (demographics) as well as changes in selection pressures- "potential to adapt"

Challenges: teasing apart demographic history from effects of selection

Why do population genomics?

-genomic environment is inherently variable

-allows one to statistically capture the variation with dense sequencing

-population genetic approaches miss out total variation because of limited sampling

**Linkage disequilibrium**- caused by physical distance due to crossover events

1) **genomic context:** selection acts on the genome locally while drift acts on the genome globally

* mean and distribution used to infer drift and small population size

* outliers allows one to infer selection

* small population size and drift act on the entire genome

**2) Demographic history**

Ne- effective population size

* behaves as a Wright-Fisher population
* idealized population; every individual has same probability of mating
* migration (gene flow) among populations (groups of individuals exchanging genes)
* divergence - times between populations

**Coalescent theory**- probability of allele copies share a common ancestor

2N allele copies in a population of Ne individuals

1/2Ne= probability of a common ancestor

* stochastic process- sample multiple alleles copies not just one to tease out variability
* MRCA- Most recent common ancestor of all allele copies
* Population bottlenecks change the rate coalescent events 
* Rate speeds up during population bottlenecks and slows down with expansion
* inferring drift based on models of coalescence
* adding mutations to find derived alleles in population

Bottlenecks- loose rare alleles and maintain common ones

Site frequency spectrum (SFS)- histogram of allele frequencies for many SNPs in a population

3) **Selection**- positive selection increases frequency of beneficial allele/variant

* nucleotide diversity- average pairwise differences between individuals
* low nucleotide diversity under positive selection
* linkage measures- increase near selected sites due to genetic hitchhiking
* cause exact same expansion in tree "bushy trees" as bottleneck but only locally- selective sweep

Lecture notes: What's the difference between Rmd vs md?

* markdown a type of language that renders it into something readable

* inserting web links: [TEXT](URL)

* numbered lists: 1. TEXT

* embedding code: ``` LINE BREAK ```

  ``` cd ~/mydata```

* This is where the class data are: ` /data/project.data`
* two windows: notebook open and terminal
* pbio381.uvm.edu server name

Learning objectives

* background on species
* understand the pipeline
* bash scripts
* sequencing quality assessment
* mapping to ref genome

Red spruce- cool moist climates, northerly distributed, higher in elevation as you move south.

* genetic basis of climate adaptation
* highly fragmented populations
* alleles that might be potentially conserved
* inform nature conservancy to improve restoration management practices for red spruce

Genomic DNA from needles (110 mother trees; 23 populations)

* ref genome based on multiple tissues and developmental stages in related species white spruce
* 80,000 probes were designed based on these transcriptomes (120 bp)
* coverage of at least one probe for 38,570 unigenes (90 bp, 85% coverage)
* fragmentation, hybridization with probes, sequenced on a Hiseq X to generate paired end 150 bp reads.
  * single end only one end is paired
  * paired ends two ends are sequenced- more powerful than single end

Pipeline

1. fastq files- compressed files containing reads 
   1. often zipped in a fastq.gz
2. visualize with fastQC- assess quality
3.  trimmed .fastq - trimmomatic- visualize again with fastQC
4. map or align those reads to ref genome with BWA (.sam)
5. post processing- samtools (.bam)
   1. look for PCR duplicates- avoiding pseudoreplication by getting rid of duplicate reads
   2. generate stats around depth and quality for each sample

`cd /data/project_data/RS_ExomeSeq//fastq/edge_fastq/`

### Entry 16: 2020-02-03, Monday.  

Paper:

Notes:

**Fst**- a measure of genetic structure developed by Sewall Wright (1969, 1978). Related to statistical analysis of variance (*ANOVA)* 

[Source]: https://www.uwyo.edu/dbmcd/popecol/maylects/popgengloss.html

*F*ST is the proportion of the total genetic variance contained in a subpopulation (the S subscript) relative to the total genetic variance (the *T* subscript). 

* Values can range from 0 to 1. High *F*ST implies a considerable degree of differentiation among populations.

**Selective Sweeps -** When a new beneficial mutation is positively selected for and a reduction or elimination of variation is observed as a result. 

* Hard sweep- typically result from rapid emergence of mutations. 
* Soft sweeps are a result of selection on a allele that is carried by multiple individuals in a population.

**Admixture**: Gene flow between two populations that are genetically differentiated, involves gene flow in both directions. Admixture can be plotted with a population structure plot, which allows one to identify the number of genetically differentiated groups in a population and the amount of admixture between the groups.

**Tajima’s D** (aka as a neutrality test) is commonly used in population genetics to determine whether a DNA sequence evolved from random processes (mutation and genetic drift) or through non-random processes (i.e. directional selection, genetic hitchhiking, introgression, etc.). It is calculated by subtracting the difference between the observed variation and the expected variation in a population. 

* A negative Tajima’s D means that genetic variation is being reduced through population expansion (i.e. recovering from small pop size) or a selective sweep (decreases variation). 
* A positive Tajima’s D suggests that genetic variation is being maintained by balancing selection or a recent population contraction.

Info session notes: Genomic diversity 

Effective population size: size of an ideal population that conforms to Wright-Fisher assumptions.

* Factors deviating Ne from N

  * non-random mating, unequal sex ratio, selection, reproductive skew, constant population size

* Seawall Wright Ne= 4Nmales x Nfemales/ Nmales + Nfemales (founded upon this equation on sex ratios)

* can be estimated by pie = Ne*u (net probability of Ne times mutation rate)

* mutation rate-units change per time per generation

* Nei's genetic distance- measurement of diversity

* Fst- population structure- 1/ pie +1 or 1 - avg H of subpop/ H for whole pop (H - heterozygosity)

* Site frequency spectrum- number of individuals (frequency) plotted against number of differentiated SNPS (polymorphisms) 

  ![](https://s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/ppreviews-plos-725668748/1170708/preview.jpg)

Frequency of rare alleles in a population. With population expansion, Ne increases, and the frequency of rare alleles will increase in a few number of individuals.

Fst = 1- pieS/pieT
